Creating a support ticket in your [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) is the best way to communicate
with Rackspace Support Technicians.  The advantage of using a ticket is that it allows you to copy & paste or attach cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error log entries directly into the ticket.

### Create a new support ticket

You can create a support ticket by:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

2. Click **TICKETS** > **Create Ticket**.

When you create a new ticket, select a broad product category,
such as Cloud Servers or Cloud Databases, and then a more
specific category that narrows down the type of problem you are
experiencing, such as General Support or API. In
the **Details** section, enter a subject and message describing your
issue. You can also attach a file up to 20 MB to the ticket. After you
have entered information into all the fields, click **Submit Ticket**.

### View support tickets

To see previously opened or closed support tickets, click **TICKETS** > **Ticket Lists**. A list displays your currently open
tickets and a tab with the option to view your closed tickets. Each
ticket entry displays the name, the date it was last updated, the ticket
status, and ticket ID number. To create a new ticket from the list view, click **Create Ticket**.
